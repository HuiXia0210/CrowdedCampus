    Class Description:
    Represents a residual graph for use in the Ford-Fulkerson max flow algorithm.
    Maintains an adjacency list of directed edges with capacities and flows. 
    
    Approach Description:
    Models a flow network where each edge tracks has a capacity and current flow.
    It maintains an adjacency list of edges and provides methods to add edges and find augmenting paths using BFS.
    The residual graph allows flow to be "pushed" along edges and reversed if needed, which is essential for updating flow in Ford-Fulkerson.
        
    Solution Description:
    The graph is represented as a list of adjacency lists, each storing Edge objects.
    When adding an edge, a forward edge with capacity and a backward edge with zero capacity are created to represent residual capacity.
    BFS is used to find paths with available capacity from source to sink. Once an augmenting path is found, the bottleneck capacity (minimum residual capacity on that path) is computed, and flow is augmented accordingly.
    These operations enable incrementally increasing flow until no augmenting path exists.

    - Stores adjacency lists for all nodes: O(V + E)

    Space Complexity Analysis:

    Function Description:
    Computes the maximum flow from the source to the sink in a given residual graph using the Ford-Fulkerson method with BFS to find augmenting paths.

    Approach Description:
    This function implements the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm using the BFS variant known as the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. It repeatedly finds an augmenting path from source to sink using BFS, calculates the bottleneck capacity of that path, 
    and augments the flow along it. This process continues until no more augmenting paths are found.

    Solution Description:
    - Initialize max_flow to 0.
    - While BFS finds a valid augmenting path:
    1. Determine the minimum residual capacity (bottleneck) along that path.
    2. Increase flow along the path by this bottleneck amount.
    3. Update the reverse edges accordingly.
    - Once no augmenting path exists, return the accumulated max_flow.

    Inputs:
    - graph (ResidualGraph): The graph containing vertices and edges with flow and capacity.
    - source (int): Index of the source vertex.
    - sink (int): Index of the sink vertex.
    - vertices (List[Vertex]): List of Vertex objects representing each node.

    Output:
    - max_flow (int): The maximum amount of flow that can be sent from source to sink.

    Time Complexity:
    - Each BFS: O(V + E), where V is number of vertices, E is number of edges.
    - Number of iterations (augmenting paths found): O(E * max_flow), in worst case.
    - Total: O(E * max_flow) using simple Ford-Fulkerson.
    With BFS (Edmonds-Karp): O(V * EÂ²), since each BFS takes O(E), and there are O(VE) iterations.

    Space Complexity: O(V + E) for graph and BFS traversal structures.

    Complexity Analysis:
    - Each call to BFS traverses the graph using adjacency lists, visiting each edge once.
    - The number of times an edge can be part of a BFS is proportional to the number of times flow is augmented before the edge becomes saturated.
    - The flow increases by at least 1 unit per iteration (in integer capacity graphs), so the total number of iterations is bounded by the maximum possible flow.

class Graph:

    Function description:  
    This class models the problem of assigning students to classes based on their time preferences and class capacity constraints. It uses a flow network with circulation and applies the 
    Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to check feasibility and compute valid assignments.

    Approach description:  
    The problem is modeled as a flow network:
    - Each student connects to the source with capacity 1 (each can join one class).
    - Each class connects to the sink with min/max student limits.
    - Students are connected to classes only if the class's time matches one of their preferences.

    To handle minimum class sizes, we use circulation: demands and a super source/sink are added to ensure constraints are respected. Lower/upper bounds on edges are encoded as adjustments to demand and capacity.

    I first check if a feasible flow exists (circulation check). If it does, it computes a flow from the original source to sink to get the actual allocation. 
    This avoids brute force or greedy logic â the assignment satisfies constraints, and multiple valid outputs may exist.

    Input:  
    - num_students: int â number of students  
    - num_classes: int â number of classes  
    - time_preferences: List[List[int]] â each student's preferred time slots  
    - class_constraints: List[List[int]] â for each class: [time_slot, min_students, max_students]  

    Output / Postcondition:  
    - get_allocation(): list[int] â for each student, the index of the assigned class, or -1 if unassigned  
    - check_feasibility(): bool â True if an assignment satisfying all constraints exists

    Time complexity:  O(nÂ²)

    Time complexity analysis:  
    The number of edges is O(nÂ²) in the worst case (each student prefers all classes).  
    Ford-Fulkerson on unit capacity graphs runs in O(EF), where F is the maximum flow (â¤ n), and E is O(n^2).  
    Since each augmenting path increases flow by 1 and DFS finds each in O(nÂ²), but with unit capacities and bounded flow, it use at most n augmentations, each costing O(nÂ²), so total is O(nÂ²).

    Space complexity:  O(n)

    Space complexity analysis: 
    Auxiliary arrays and temporary objects (e.g., demand[], visited[], vertex states) take O(n) space.  
    Graph storage is excluded from auxiliary space per problem definition.

    """
    Function Description:
    Assign students to classes respecting their time preferences to satisfy at least a minimum number of students using a flow network and Ford-Fulkerson max flow algorithm.

    Approach Description:
    The core of the problem is to assign students to classes such that students only get classes offered at times they prefer, and the total number of satisfied students
    meets a required minimum. Instead of enumerating all possible allocations (which is combinatorial and inefficient) or using a greedy heuristic (which may fail to find
    feasible solutions), the problem is modeled as a flow network.

    In this model:
    - Each student is represented as a node connected from a sourcenode.
    - Each class is represented as a node connected to a sink node.
    - Edges from students to classes exist only if the class time matches the student's preferred times, forming possible valid assignments.

    The capacity on each edge is typically 1, enforcing that one student can take one class.
    Finding a maximum flow through this network corresponds to assigning as many students as possible to classes they prefer.

    The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is implemented to find a feasible maximum flow, which gives an allocation meeting the minimum satisfaction.

    Input:
    - n (int): Number of students.
    - m (int): Number of classes.
    - timePreferences (List[List[int]]): Each student's ordered list of preferred class times (a full permutation of 0 to 19).
    - proposedClasses (List[List[int]]): List of classes with their time slots.
    - minimumSatisfaction (int): Minimum number of students to satisfy.

    Output:
    - List[int]: Allocation list assigning each student to a class index, or -1 if none.
    - None if no feasible allocation meets minimum satisfaction.

    Time Complexity: O(n^2), dominated by Ford-Fulkerson max flow.

    Time Complexity Analysis: Graph size limited by preferences, max 5 edges per student initially, max flow runs in O(n^2) worst-case, possibly twice due to two attempts.

    Space Complexity: O(n) auxiliary space for graph and allocations.

class WordTrie:
    """
    Class Description:
    Implements a Trie to store a list of words and support searching
    for words that have exactly one substitution difference from a given word.

    Approach Description:
    The trie allows efficient word insertion and flexible recursive search.
    The insert() method builds the trie from the input words.
    The match_with_one_substitution() method initializes a result list and calls _search(), 
    a recursive function that:
    - Traverses the trie character-by-character.
    - Tracks whether a character was substituted.
    - On reaching the end of the word with exactly one substitution and is_end=True, adds the result.
    A path list is used to build candidate words during traversal efficiently, avoid string concatenation overhead.
   
    Output/Postcondition: 
    - Trie is built with inserted words. 
    - Can return list of words with one substitution from input.

    Time Complexity:
       - insert: O(L), where L is the length of the word being inserted.
       - match_with_one_substitution: O(J*N) + O(X)

    Time Complexity Analysis:
       - insert: Each character added sequentially to Trie, no backtracking.
       - match: For J-character word, explore up to 26 branches at each level, bounded by N.

    Space Complexity:
       - insert: O(C), for total characters stored
       - match: O(X), where X is the total output character count.

    Space Complexity Analysis:
       - Trie grows as O(C) total for all insertions.
       - path array is reused; result list only grows with successful matches.

        Starting from the root, for each character in the word, the method calculates the index
